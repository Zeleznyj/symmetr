API
===

The program can be used from python directly, which allows automation or further manipulation of the results.

For the response mode the main function to use is :func:`symmetr.funcs_main.sym_res`, analogous function for the mham mode is :func:`symmetr.funcs_main.sym_mham`. The input parameters are parsed using a function :func:`symmetr.input.parse`, which takes as an input string that contains parameters exactly like when used from command line.

Example:

.. code:: python

   from symmetr import sym_res, parse

   res = sym_res(parse('res j E -f input.in'))


The format of the output changes depending on the exact parameters used. In a typical case as shown here the response is a list containing the two components of the response tensor. The tensor themselves are instances of the :class:`symmetr.tensors.Tensor` class, described in detail :doc:`here </tensors>`.

Some of the features of the code are described here in more detail. See :doc:`here </symmetries>` for description of how to obtain the symmetries for given material. :doc:`here </symmetrization>` you can find description of how to define a custom symmetrization.

You can find more information in the :doc:`autogenerated code documentation </full_api>`, although note that this is incomplete.
